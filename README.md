# denoising-autoencoder
Yet Another Autoencoder for UNIVPM.

MATLAB implementation of an Autoencoder using "Deep Learning Toolbox" Framework.
The project revolved around studying and finding:
- Activation Function for image encoding
- Activation Function for image decoding
- Learning Rate for neural-network training Back Propagation
- Methods for statistical learning

For:
- Denoising and de-occlusion on MNIST handwritten digit database
- Denoising and de-occlusion on Yale Faces Database
